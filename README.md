# Real_Time_Emotion_Detection_GUI
Real-time and Simple Emotion Detection using Machine Learning
**Overview**
This project implements a real-time emotion detection as well as simple emotion detection system that operates on streaming video data, identifying the predominant emotion in each frame. The system utilizes a deep learning model trained on a dataset of labeled images.

**Features**

**Real-Time Processing**: Continuous analysis of streaming video frames for instant emotion detection.
**Frame-Level Prediction**: The system predicts the predominant emotion in each frame of the video stream.

**Important Note:** 
1.The gui.py corresponds to simple emotion detection in form of images.
2.The guir.py corresponds to real time emotion analysis in each frame of the video stream.
